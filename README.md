# Machine-Learning-Specialization

## This specilization course that I am following cover three course:
 - [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
 - [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
 - [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
 
 The purpose of this repository is to not copy the labs and projects of these courses but to follow along and understand and input my own insights in this learning phase
